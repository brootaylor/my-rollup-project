# A RollupJS project

Nothing fancy really. A bit of a play around and trying to familiarise myself on how to set up a possible RollupJS config.

Also some SCSS, static file copying and service worker versioning snuck its way in as well. ðŸ˜‰

## What it does

### `"prebuild": "npm run clean"`

`prebuild` runs the `clean` command script that removes the `dist` directory and all its contents. It *automatically runs* before running the scripts within the `build` script.

---

### `"build": "npm run scripts && npm run styles && npm run static"`

`npm run build` runs the `scripts`, `styles` and `static` command scripts.

---

## `"server": "http-server ./dist -g -o -c-1"`

`npm run server` starts up a local sever - aka `http-server` - to run the web application in the browser. The `-g`, `-o` and `-c-1` options are to gzip, automatically run in the browser and prevent caching, respectively.

## Versioning method

Using commands like the following to automatically update / change the `package.json` *version* number...

* `npm version major`
  * eg. __*1*__.0.0
* `npm version minor`
  * eg. 1.__*1*__.0
* `npm version patch`
  * eg. 1.0.__*1*__

---

To make the `git commit` more meaningful, add a *message* to the version `major`, `minor` or `patch`.

**Something like this...**

`npm version patch -m "Upgraded to version %s. Updated the service worker."`
