# A RollupJS project

Nothing fancy really. Just a bit of a play around and familiarosation of how to set up a possible RollupJS config. Blah dee blah!

## Versioning

Using commands like the following to automatically update / change the `package.json` *version* number...

* `npm version major`
* `npm version minor`
* `npm version patch`

---

To make the `git commit` more meaningful, add a *message* to the version `major`, `minor` or `patch`.

**Something like this...**

`npm version patch -m "Upgraded to version %s. Updated the service worker."`
